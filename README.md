# CSV Expense Tracker

You can upload a bank statement which at least where I'm from can easily be downloaded
as a CSV file from your online bank, and the app then converts the file to JSON behind the scenes and calculates income and expenses,
as well as the difference between the two. The data is not stored in any database. Everything happens in the browser.
